# HealthChoice

HealthChoice simplifies the lives of consumers who want to take care of their health and who face the plethora of products available on the market. Faced with nutrition tables that are not always clear and easy to read, the HealthChoice app helps you choose products that are equivalent to a given product, but that are healthier and offer a better nutritional score.

Healthchoice therefore proposes to show you healthier products but also allows you to keep them close at hand so that you can find them easily. 

*This app uses openfoodfacts public data.*

## How to use:

The user is on the terminal. The latter shows him the following choices:

1. 1 - Which food do you want to replace?
1. 2 - Find my substituted foods.

The user selects 1. The program asks the user the following questions and the user selects the answers:

* Select the category. [10 proposals associated with a number. The user enters the corresponding digit and presses enter]
* Select the un healthy product. [10 proposals associated with a number. The user enters the digit corresponding to the chosen food and presses enter]
* The program offers a substitute, its description, a store or buy it (if any) and a link to the Open Food Facts page about that food.
* The user then has the possibility to save the substitute and the substitued product as a favorite in the database.
